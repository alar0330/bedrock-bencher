{"prompt": "If all roses are flowers, and some flowers are red, can we conclude that some roses are red?", "expected_response": "No, we cannot conclude that some roses are red from the given premises. While all roses are flowers, and some flowers are red, the red flowers could be entirely non-roses. The premises don't establish any connection between roses and the red flowers.", "metadata": {"type": "logical_reasoning", "difficulty": "medium", "fallacy_type": "affirming_the_consequent", "domain": "syllogistic_logic"}}
{"prompt": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?", "expected_response": "The ball costs $0.05. If the ball costs x, then the bat costs x + $1.00. So x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10, which means 2x + $1.00 = $1.10, so 2x = $0.10, and x = $0.05.", "metadata": {"type": "mathematical_reasoning", "difficulty": "medium", "cognitive_bias": "system_1_thinking", "domain": "algebra"}}
{"prompt": "You have 12 balls, 11 of which weigh the same. One ball is either heavier or lighter. Using a balance scale only 3 times, how do you find the different ball?", "expected_response": "Divide into groups of 4. First weighing: Compare group A vs group B. If balanced, the different ball is in group C. If unbalanced, it's in the heavier or lighter group. Second weighing: Take 3 balls from the suspect group and compare with 3 normal balls. Third weighing: If the previous was balanced, the remaining ball is different. If unbalanced, compare 2 of the 3 suspect balls to determine which is different.", "metadata": {"type": "puzzle_solving", "difficulty": "hard", "domain": "combinatorial_optimization", "strategy": "divide_and_conquer"}}
