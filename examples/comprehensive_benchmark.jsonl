{"prompt": "Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms.", "expected_response": "Quantum entanglement is when two particles become connected in such a way that measuring one instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are. It's like having two magic coins that always land on opposite sides - if one shows heads, the other will always show tails, even if they're on different planets.", "metadata": {"category": "science", "difficulty": "medium", "field": "physics", "explanation_level": "layperson", "word_count_target": 50}}

{"prompt": "What are the ethical implications of AI in healthcare?", "expected_response": "AI in healthcare raises several ethical concerns: privacy and data security of patient information, potential bias in algorithms that could lead to unequal treatment, the need for transparency in AI decision-making, questions about liability when AI makes errors, and ensuring human oversight remains in critical medical decisions. There's also concern about job displacement and maintaining the human element in patient care.", "metadata": {"category": "ethics", "domain": "healthcare", "complexity": "high", "stakeholders": ["patients", "doctors", "hospitals"], "considerations": ["privacy", "bias", "transparency", "accountability"]}}
{"prompt": "Describe the water cycle.", "expected_response": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through Earth's systems. It begins with evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers, where solar energy turns liquid water into water vapor. This vapor rises and cools, forming clouds through condensation. When clouds become heavy, precipitation occurs as rain, snow, or hail. Water then flows back to bodies of water through runoff or seeps into the ground as groundwater, completing the cycle.", "metadata": {"category": "science", "field": "earth_science", "grade_level": "middle_school", "key_processes": ["evaporation", "condensation", "precipitation", "collection"], "difficulty": "easy"}}
{"prompt": "If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be and why?", "expected_response": "I would choose Leonardo da Vinci because of his incredible versatility as an artist, inventor, scientist, and philosopher. His curiosity about everything from human anatomy to flying machines was boundless. I'd love to discuss his creative process, how he balanced art and science, and hear his thoughts on modern technology. His notebooks show someone who was constantly questioning and experimenting, and I think the conversation would be endlessly fascinating.", "metadata": {"category": "creative", "type": "hypothetical", "requires": ["historical_knowledge", "personal_reasoning"], "response_style": "conversational", "expected_elements": ["choice", "justification", "specific_examples"]}}
